Welcome to the course "Analysis of ranking data from crowdsourcing citizen-science". The aim of this course is that you learn the principles to analyse the ranking data generated through the triadic comparison of technologies (tricot) approach data.  

## How this course works

The course starts from the understanding that you have a notion on the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language. If you are new in R or never used it, I recommend that you take (and re-take as many times as needed) the "[Short introduction to R](02_introduction_to_R.html)". There you will find the elements that you need to learn for this course and some extra reading to make you ready.

You read the materials and watch the lectures in your own time. Your team leader (or contact point) will probably set a deadline for your group to complete the training. After that the team leader will organize with me a Q&A section where all the group participants will meet (on-line). In this Q&A we will work with your own tricot data (if any) and talk about your questions.

Good luck!

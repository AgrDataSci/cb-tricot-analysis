Welcome to the course "Analysis of citizen-science data generated by the tricot approach". The aim of this course is that you learn the principles to analyse the tricot data and how to interpret the results.  

The course starts from the understanding that you have a notion on the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language. If you are new in R or never used it, I recommend that you take (and re-take as many times as needed) our "[Short introduction to R](02_introduction_to_R.html)". There you will find the elements that we need for this course and some extra reading to make you ready.

## Course content

These are the topics that we are going to study. 

1. [Course Overview](01_course_overview.html)
2. [Short introduction to R](02_introduction_to_R.html)
3. [Project-oriented workflow](03_project_oriented_workflow.html)
4. [Introduction to Plackett-Luce model](04_introduction_plmodel.html)
5. [*tricot* rankings into Plackett-Luce rankings](05_tricot_into_plrank.html)
6. [Get data from ClimMob to R](06_climmob_in_r.html)
7. Visualization and summary
8. Plackett-Luce Trees
9. Model selection 
10. Q&A (organize with teams)


## How this course works

You read the materials and watch the videos in your own time. Your team leader (or contact point) will probably set a deadline for your group to complete the training. After that the team leader will organize with me a Q&A section where all the group participates will meet (on-line). In this Q&A we will work with your own tricot data (if any) and talk about your questions.

Good luck!

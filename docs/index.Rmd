Welcome to the course "Analysis of citizen-science data generated by the tricot approach". The aim of this course is that you learn the principles to analyse the tricot data and how to interpret the results.  

The course starts from the understanding that you have a notion on the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language. If you are new in R or never used it, I recommend that you take (and re-take as many times as needed) our "[Short introduction to R](02_introduction_to_R.html)". There you will find the elements that we need for this course and some extra reading to make you ready.

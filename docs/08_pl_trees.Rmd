# Set up

For this lecture we need to packages following packages. We load the packages with `library()`. 

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library("PlackettLuce")
library("qvcalc")
library("gosset")
library("patchwork")
library("ggparty")
library("climatrends")
library("nasapower")
library("ClimMobTools")
```

# Example 1: Sweetpotato data

We first read the .csv file with the function `read.csv()`

```{r eval=TRUE, message=TRUE, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
dt <- read.csv("../data/sweet_potato.csv")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dt <- read.csv("data/sweet_potato.csv")
```

```{r}
str(dt)
```

For this analysis we keep only the Ghana data

```{r}
dt <- dt[dt$country == "Ghana", ]
```

And then we transform the tricot rankings into a PlackettLuce rankings. We use the overall preference on the genotypes

```{r}

R <- rank_tricot(data = dt,
                 items = c("item_A","item_B","item_C"),
                 input = c("best_overall","worst_overall"))


head(R)

```


## Fit a PlackettLuce model

To fit a PlackettLuce model we use the function `PlackettLuce()`. To know more about the model read the paper by [Turner et al (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00180-020-00959-3).

```{r}
mod <- PlackettLuce(R)

summary(mod)
```

We define a reference item (variety). This helps us in identifying whether a widely used variety is better of worse than the new genotypes.

```{r}
ref = "SARI-Nyumingre (Obare)"

summary(mod, ref = ref)
```

The model coefficients can be obtained using the function `coef()`. The first example take the coefficients in the log format, the log-worth. If we apply the argument `log = FALSE` this returns the probability of winning (worth). The sum of these probabilities should always be 1.

```{r}
coef(mod, ref = ref)

coef(mod, log = FALSE)

sum(coef(mod, log = FALSE))
```

We can plot these coefficients with the error bars using the function `qvcalc()`

```{r}
plot(qvcalc(mod, ref = ref))
```

## PlackettLuce with covariates

With the function `pltree()` we can fit a PlackettLuce model recursively to find instabilities in the rankings that are represented by a set of covariates. The rankings are recursively split into two groups according to their value on covariates whose values vary between rankings, and a PlackettLuce model is fitted to each subgroup formed. The method proceeds as follows:

1. Fit a Plackett–Luce model to the full data.

2. Assess the stability of the worth parameters with respect to each covariate. That is, test for a structural change in the ranking-level contributions to the first derivatives of the log-likelihood, when these contributions are ordered by covariate values.

3. If there is significant instability, split the full data by the covariate with the strongest instability, using the cut-point that gives the highest improvement in model fit.

4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each subgroup until there are no more significant instabilities, or a split produces a subgroup below a given size threshold.

We select the covariates age and gender. We coerce age into integer and gender into factor.

```{r}
sel <- c("age", "gender")

covar <- dt[sel]

covar$age <- as.integer(covar$age)
covar$gender <- as.factor(covar$gender)
```

Let's check for NA's in these variables. We use the function `apply()` to run over the rows of covar an look for the sum of NAs in each row. A value of 0 means no NA, which is what we are looking for.

```{r}
sum(is.na(covar))

keep <- apply(covar, 1, function(x){
  sum(is.na(x))
})

keep <- keep == 0
```

Apply the filter in the dt and covar data frames

```{r}
covar <- covar[keep, ]
dt <- dt[keep, ]

```

We then use the function `rank_tricot()` to create the `grouped_rankings`. This allows the rankings to be linked to the covariates and fit the model using `pltree()`. The rankings are combined with the covariates using the function `cbind()`.

```{r}
G <- rank_tricot(data = dt,
                 items = c("item_A","item_B","item_C"),
                 input = c("best_overall","worst_overall"),
                 group = TRUE)

pldt <- cbind(G, covar)

head(pldt)
```

Now we can fit the tree. The first argument is the formula with response variable being the first followed by the covariates indicated with a `~` sign.

```{r}
pl <- pltree(G ~ age + gender, data = pldt, alpha = 0.1)

summary(pl)
```

The rankings split with the covariate age. We can use the function `plot()` to see the tree.

```{r}
plot(pl)
```

The function `plot_tree()` is still under development in the package gosset. With this function we can see the tree with the points and error bar.

```{r}
gosset:::plot_tree(pl)
```

We can also extract the coefficients from each node like before. 

```{r}
coef(pl)
```

The model can also be used for predictions with the function `predict()`

```{r}
head(predict(pl))
```


# Example 2: Breadwheat data

The breadwheat is a dataframe from tricot trials of bread wheat (*Triticum aestivum* L.) varieties in India. This is a sample data available at [ClimMob](https://climmob.net/) that can be fetched using the function `getDataCM()` from ClimMobTools.

```{r fetch}
key <- "d39a3c66-5822-4930-a9d4-50e7da041e77"

dt <- getDataCM(key = key,
                project = "breadwheat",
                pivot.wider = TRUE)


names(dt)

```

We remove some strings in the colunm names 

```{r}
names(dt) <- gsub("firstassessment_|package_|lastassessment_|registration_", 
                  "",
                  names(dt))

```


## Tricot data with environmental covariates

We can add environmental covariates from package [climatrends](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=climatrends). Here we use the function `temperature()` to compute the temperature indices for the first 80 days after planting. We first convert the planting dates into an object of class `Date`, and the longitude and latitude into `numeric`.

```{r temperature}
dt$plantingdate <- as.Date(dt$plantingdate, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
dt$lon <- as.numeric(dt$farm_geo_longitude)
dt$lat <- as.numeric(dt$farm_geo_latitude)

temp <- temperature(dt[, c("lon","lat")], 
                    day.one = dt[, "plantingdate"],
                    span = 80)

temp
```


We build the farmers' rankings as an object of class 'grouped_rankings'. 


```{r plrankings}
G <- rank_tricot(dt, 
                 items = c("item_A","item_B","item_C"), 
                 input = c("overallperf_pos","overallperf_neg"),
                 group = TRUE)

dat <- cbind(G, temp)

```

We fit the model using the function `pltree()`

```{r}
pl <- pltree(G ~ maxNT + maxDT, 
             data = dat)

summary(pl)

gosset:::plot_tree(pl)
```

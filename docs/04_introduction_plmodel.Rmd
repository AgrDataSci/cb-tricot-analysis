# Rank-based models

Rankings data arise in a range of applications, such as sport tournaments and consumer studies. In rankings data, each observation is an ordering of a set of items.

Classic models are Bradley-Terry and Plackett-Luce

The first works with pairwise comparisons and the last with rankings with > 3 items. It measures the odds that one option is chosen over a set of options

# Plackett-Luce model

Is a classic model for rank data. This model depends on Luce’s axiom of choice (Luce 1959, 1977) which states that the odds of choosing an item over another do not depend on the set of items from which the choice is made.

# Set up

For this lecture we need to packages PlackettLuce, ggplot2, gosset and igraph. We load the packages with `library()`. We also load some extra functions from the workflow employed in the ClimMob platform.

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library("PlackettLuce")
library("ggplot2")
library("gosset")
library("igraph")
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AgrDataSci/ClimMob-analysis/master/R/functions.R")
```


# Example 1: Beans data

Load the data of beans tricot trials from the package PlackettLuce 

```{r}
data("beans", package = "PlackettLuce")
str(beans)
```


## Contingency table

The function `table()` builds a contingency table of the counts at each combination of characters or factor levels. Let's see the number of points in the beans data per season.

```{r}
table(beans$season)
```


Now number of varieties that were tested in the project. For this we use the function `unlist()` to coerce the three columns with the variety names into a vector of length 2526 (nrow(beans) x 3)

```{r}
items <- unlist(beans[,c("variety_a", "variety_b", "variety_c")])

table(items)

```

And now we see how these varieties were tested across each season. For this, we pass the vector items as first argument and repeat the vector beans$season three times to match the length of the items using the function `rep()`.

```{r}
table(items, rep(beans$season, 3))
```

## Plot methods 

We can use the function `density()` to compute a kernel density estimate of the maximum night temperature registed in the locations where the on-farm trials were stablished. To visualize this density, we use the function `plot()`.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
plot(density(beans$maxTN), 
     main = "Kernel density of maximun night temperature")
```

We can visualize this variable through their quartiles and check for any outlier with `boxplot()` for visualization and `boxplot.stats()` to get the statistics of the box plot.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
boxplot(beans$maxTN)
```

With the function `plot()` we can also plot the coordinates of each on-farm trial registered in the bean trial. 

```{r, fig.align='center'}
plot(beans[,c("lon", "lat")])
```

The output is not so informative as it is simply a scatterplot where the axys Y is the latitude and X is the longitude. We can improve this visualization by applying a layer of geographic coverage to get an idea where these trials were set. We use an internal function of the ClimMob workflow powered by the package leaflet.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
plot_map(beans, c("lon", "lat"), map_provider = "OpenStreetMap.Mapnik")
```


## Rank visualization

First we coerce the tricot rankings into a PlackettLuce rankings 

```{r}
R <- rank_tricot(data = beans,
                 items = c("variety_a","variety_b","variety_c"),
                 input = c("best","worst"))
head(R)
```


We can see the network (how these varieties are connected) of this trial by computing the adjacency of rankings with the function `adjacency()` from PlackettLuce and the function `network()` from the ClimMob workflow.

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
a <- adjacency(R)

a <- network(a)

plot(a)
```

###  Favourability score

The function `summarise_favourite()` computes the favourability score from permutations contests. The favourability score is the difference between the wins and losses of a given item in a paired comparison.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
fav <- summarise_favourite(R)

fav
```

It has a plot method powered by the package [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) which offer many options to change its layout. 

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = '70%', dpi = 600}
plot(fav) + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```

### Victories

The function `summarise_victories()` summarises the relative number of times a "player1" wins against a "player2" in a paired comparison. 

```{r}
vic <- summarise_victories(R)

head(vic)
```

Also with a plot method that passes ggplot2 arguments 

```{r, fig.align='center'}
plot(vic) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```

# Example 2: Sweetpotato data

This is the data from [Moyo et al (2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.620363) who tested the consumers' preference on sweetpotato materials (varieties and genotypes) in Ghana and Uganda. The data is available [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4012057) and also in the classroom materials in the "data/" folder.

We first read the .csv file with the function `read.csv()`

```{r eval=TRUE, message=TRUE, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
dt <- read.csv("../data/sweet_potato.csv")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dt <- read.csv("data/sweet_potato.csv")
```

```{r}
str(dt)
```

## Agreement between rankings

We are going to compare rankings from the three traits evaluated in the sweetpotato trial (taste, color and overall) using overall as baseline. We use the function `summarise_agreement()` which computes the [Kendall correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient) between rankings, and the agreement between the first and last ranked varieties. 

First, we subset the main dataset to retain only the Uganda data. The condition `dt$country == "Uganda"` passed in the rows of `dt` return a logical vector (`TRUE FALSE`) for the observations in `dt$country` that are equal to Uganda.

```{r}
keep <- dt$country == "Uganda"

dt <- dt[keep, ]

dim(dt)
```

Now we isolate the strings for the traits assessed in Uganda. We use the function `paste0()` to create a vector that represents the traits and their names in `dt` with the strings `best_` and `worst_`

```{r}
traits <- c("overall","taste","color")

sel <- paste0(c("best_","worst_"), rep(traits, each = 2))

sel
```

We use an [iteration](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html) with `for` to create the rankings. Iterations are often used to optimize processes and enable a better debugging structure

We create an empty list and the rankings that are going to be created in each iteration `i` performed along the vector `traits`

```{r}
R <- list()

for(i in seq_along(traits)){
  
  R[[i]] <- rank_tricot(dt, 
                        items = c("item_A", "item_B", "item_C"),
                        input = paste0(c("best_","worst_"), traits[[i]]))
  
}
```

We can now compare the rankings. The first argument is the baseline wich is the first element in the list `R`, we indicate it with `R[[1]]` where 1 is the index for the first element in the list. The second argument is the list with rankings to compare, we indicate it with `R[-1]` where -1 tells to R to use all the elements in the list besides the first.

```{r}
a <- summarise_agreement(R[[1]],
                         compare.to = R[-1],
                         labels = c("Taste","Colour"))

a
```

We can also plot it with the ggplot2 methods 

```{r, fig.align='center'}
plot(a) + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```
